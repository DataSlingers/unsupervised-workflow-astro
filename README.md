# Unsupervised Workflow Case Study: Finding Common Origins of Milky Way Stars

## Overview

This repository contains all code necessary to reproduce the unsupervised workflow case study from:

Andersen Chang*, Tiffany M. Tang*, Tarek M. Zikry*, and Genevera I. Allen. "Unsupervised Machine Learning for Scientific Discovery: Workflow and Best Practices". (2025+)

In this case study, we leverage the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), a large high-resolution spectroscopic survey of stars comprising the disk (i.e., the primary area of the Milky Wayâ€™s stellar mass), in order to identify groups of stars in the Milky Way with similar chemical properties and to gain insights into the shared origins of stars that were formed together. 

To view the results of this case study, please see our [interactive html notebooks](https://dataslingers.github.io/unsupervised-workflow-astro/).

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the full case study from scratch:

1. Download `allstars_gc.csv` data from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15565719), and move `allstars_gc.csv` into `unsupervised-workflow-astro/data/` folder.

2. For RStudio users, open up the R project `unsupervised-workflow-astro.Rproj` in RStudio. For non-RStudio users, change directories to the root repository directory (i.e., `unsupervised-workflow-astro/`) and open up R.

3. Restore the reproducible R environment, containing all necessary dependencies, by typing in the R console:
   ```r
   renv::restore()
   ```
   *Note*: If `renv` was not previously installed, you may need to install the `renv` R package manually via `install.packages("renv")`.

4. Render the quarto notebooks in the `unsupervised-workflow-astro/notebooks/` folder (in numeric order). This can be done by either clicking the "Render" button in RStudio for each notebook, or by running the following commands (sequentially) in command line:
    ```bash
    # set number of cores to use for parallel processing
    export NCORES=4
    # make sure you are working in the root directory of the repository
    # cd /path/to/unsupervised-workflow-astro/
    # to render data preparation notebook
    quarto render notebooks/01-astro-case-study-data.qmd
    # to render exploratory data analysis notebook
    quarto render notebooks/02-astro-case-study-eda.qmd
    # to render dimension reduction notebook
    quarto render notebooks/03-astro-case-study-dimension-reduction.qmd
    # to render clustering training notebook (takes a while)
    quarto render notebooks/04-astro-case-study-clustering-train.qmd
    # to render clustering validation notebook
    quarto render notebooks/05-astro-case-study-clustering-validation.qmd
    # to render clustering interpretation notebook
    quarto render notebooks/06-astro-case-study-clustering-interpretation.qmd
    # to render all notebooks in the folder
    quarto render
    ```
    *Note:* If you have not installed quarto, you must do so (see https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) before rendering these notebooks.

5. Open `unsupervised-workflow-astro/docs/index.html` in your web browser to view the results.

**Note**: If you prefer not to re-generate the results yourself (e.g., due to the high computational cost), you can download the processed APOGEE data and all generated results files from Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/records/15565719. Place the downloaded `allstars_gc.csv` and `astro_cleaned_data.RData` files in the `unsupervised-workflow-astro/data/` folder, and place all other files in the `unsupervised-workflow-astro/results/` folder. You can then run `quarto render` from your terminal to render and view the resulting notebook.
